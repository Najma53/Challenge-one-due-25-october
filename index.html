            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of orienting your website to rank higher on a search engine results page (SERP) so that you receive more traffic. The aim is typically to rank on the first page of Google results for search terms that mean the most to your target audience.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>
                What is social media marketing?
                Social media marketing (SMM) is a form of internet marketing that uses social media apps as a marketing tool.
                
                These social media platforms enable brands to connect with their audience to:
                
                build a brand;
                increase sales;
                drive traffic to a website; and
                build a community of followers to share and engage with content.
