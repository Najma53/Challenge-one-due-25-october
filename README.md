# Challenge-one-due-25-october
As a bootcamp student, I want Horiseon webpage to look great and follow accessibility standards so that the page is optimized for search engines.
## Description
The project requires to use 
* Semantic HTML elements 
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
## Getting Started
* Step 1
1. Created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to my computer.

2. Then I deployed it by using the `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.

3. I Navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

4. On the Settings page, scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the `main` branch as my source.

5.This led to my webpage viral https://najma53.github.io/Challenge-one-due-25-october
Notes (Navigate to <your-github-username.github.io/your-repository-name> and you will find that your new webpage has gone live! For example, if your GitHub username is "lernantino" and the project is "css-demo-site", then your URL would be <lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site>.)
* Step 2
1. Using the terminal opened VS Code
2. Started looking at index.html file and changing text and saving and opening in live browser to see what each changes does and how the webpage is progressing.
3. Along with index html file , CSS style was also looked at and different variable were changed at different times to see visual change on webpage.
4. Certain things were not linked so that was fixed as well.
5. Layout was changed a bit to fit all in one page.
6. Git add -A, Git commit -m" description of changes" and git push origin main command were used to link my changes from my laptop to my repository on github.
